## Hi there 👋

Polish beginner programmer on his way to get the first IT job

I decided to improve my skills only in the backend: Spring Boot 🍃

Before I started coding I spent 4 months to learning about linux, networking and computer science

I've tested many distros, but my favorite for its simplicity and reliability it's just Linux Mint/Ubuntu (cinnamon 🫶)

I don't like use commands that I don't know what they actually do I need to know how things work

I've never participated in bootcamps and have not studied any IT-related subject, I am self-taught

#### Fun facts:

* I've been a truck driver (Poland, Germany, Czech Republic)
* I love listening creepypastas
* Coffee addicted

</br>
See you 😎
